Hover states with a subtle lift or glow effect

Cards:
Use layered backgrounds with light gradients or soft patterns (subtle waves, dots)

Shadow and soft border to separate from background

Game Elements:
Icons: playful and vector-based (e.g. feather icons, heroicons)

Progress bars: animated pastel fills

Interaction types (drag & drop, sliders): use gradient tracks and soft color-coded feedback

🪄 Micro-Interactions
Correct answer: Small burst animation or glowing halo

Wrong answer: Gentle shake and encouragement text

Level up: Confetti pop or badge unlock with fanfare sound

🧢 Logo Usage
Keep logo colors white or deep navy on colored backgrounds

Logo should always have padding (min 16px) around it

Can be paired with tagline: "Play, Learn, Grow." (or we can come up with a tagline if you want)
